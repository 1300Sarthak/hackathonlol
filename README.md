# Cluely Clone (1 to 1 recreation of cluely.com)

An invisible AI co-pilot that reads your screen and listens to conversations to provide intelligent, context-aware assistance during meetings, interviews, and technical discussions.

## 📖 **The Story Behind This Project**

This project was born from my research into [cluely.com](https://cluely.com) and their founder Roy Lee. After discovering that Cluely's system prompts for both personal use and enterprise had been leaked, I realized their application was essentially a glorified ChatGPT wrapper with a sophisticated system prompt.

During my research on Roy Lee, I discovered an interesting connection: he was reportedly kicked out of Columbia University for creating an "Interview Coder" application - essentially the same concept as Cluely, but specifically designed to help cheat on coding interviews. This revelation led me to search for the original Interview Coder project.

To my surprise, I found that Interview Coder had been an open-source, free-to-use project months ago before it was taken down. I downloaded the source code and decided to recreate Cluely based directly on that foundation, maintaining the free-to-use philosophy while requiring users to provide their own OpenAI API keys.

This project is a direct recreation of Cluely's functionality, built on the ethical foundation of the original Interview Coder project, and enhanced with modern AI capabilities.
